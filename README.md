## Documentation

Common topics are discussed in the [docs](http://soixantecircuits.github.io/nd). Make sure to read it!

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init soixantecircuits/nd my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

You can define settings variables for your project in several ways like loading them from a file, from the environment or from command line options.
nd uses [standard-settings](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/standard-settings). It will try to load settings automatically from the environment, the command line arguments, from the default settings files `settings/settings.default.json` and `settings/settings.json`.
You can specify a `settings` variable in any of those methods, and if it contains a path to a json file, settings will also be loaded from that file
``` bash
$ customVar=42 npm run dev
  or
$ settings="/path/to/custom/settings.json" npm run dev
  or (for electron)
$ npm run build
$ ./releases/test-linux-x64/project -- --settings="/path/to/custom/settings.json"
```
If your app is set up to use electron, you can get the loaded settings with `require('electron').remote.getGlobal('settings')`.
If your app is not using electron, the loaded settings are stored in the global variable `SETTINGS`.

If your app is built for electron and you want to use devtools, simply define a variable `DEVTOOLS` in your settings. It will open it when you launch your app.

## What's Included

- `npm start`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint
  - Source maps
  - Autorun `npm run electron` in Electron enabled apps.

- `npm run build`: Production ready build.
  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).
  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).
  - All static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and a production `index.html` is auto-generated with proper URLs to these generated assets.

- `npm run electron`: developpers friendly features when working in a dev environment.
  - Auto opens the devtools.

- `npm run package`: Package your app for distribution with [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
  - Portable version of your app (NodeJS and WebKit embedded).
  - Package for Windows/OS X/Linux.
  - Remove all `devDependencies` from the packaged binary, reducing final size a lot.

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:

``` bash
vue init username/repo my-project
```

The neodymium stack was originally designed as a yeoman generator. You can take a look [here](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/neodymium).
